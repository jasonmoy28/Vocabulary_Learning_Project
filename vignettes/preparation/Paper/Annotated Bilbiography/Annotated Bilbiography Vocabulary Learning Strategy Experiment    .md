# Present Study

## Contribution to the literature: 

Research question: 

1. Do produdcitve and receptive training outperform restudy in both direction posttest **without controlling for time**? 
2. Do produdcitve and receptive training outperform restudy in both direction posttest **controlling for time**? 
   * Do the benefit of taking same-direction test will be moderated by time? 
3. Will preferences of the training method moderate the aforementioned result? 



IV: 

1. type of trianing (productive vs. receptive vs. restudy)
2. type of posttest (productive vs. receptive)
3. preferences (prefer vs. not prefered)



DV

1. Number of correctly recalled word 
2. Time or efficiency (i.e. efficency = $\frac{Correct.recalled.word}{time}$)



Approach for statistical analysis: 

1. Efficiency: 
   * ANCOVA: 
     * Anserwed question: Do the benefit of taking same-direction test will be moderated by time? 
     * Time will use as the covariate variable 
     * Can do model comparison with the ANOVA that without time as the moderator  
   * ANOVA: 
     * Anserwed quetion: Which training condition is most efficient? 
     * Efficiency will be DV which is caculated by 
     * More inutitve intepretation 

2. Perferences: 
   * Will use full ANOVA to assess three-way interaction 



## Time Control Measure 

* Grinffin & Harley (1996): 24 seconds per word in learning  (time is control based on the whole training session)
* Mondria & Wiersma (2004): 56 seconds per word in learning (time is control based on each word) 
* Webb (2009): 36 seconds per word in learning (time is control based on the whole training session)
* Yangasiwa (2016): 4 seconds per word in learning (time is control baesd on each word)
* Waring (1997): 
* Webb (2005): 



## Need Access

* Waring (1997) 
* Stoddard (1929)

* 16 French words 
* Receptive practice test: recall dutch (L1) given French (L2)
* Productive practice test: recall French (L2) given dutch (L1)
* Posttest is adminstered immediate and 2 weeks later 

Result: 

* Delayed **receptive** posttst:  
  * productive + receptive (7.9) = receptive (7.7)
  * productive + receptive (7.9)  > productive (6.6)
  * receptive (7.7) = productive (6.6): **note 16% higher but did not reach significant**

Participants:

*  64 Englsih-speaking students in New Zealand without no piror knowledge of Swahili 

IV & DV: 

* IV: recognition vs. recall vs. hybrid (recognition + recall) vs. productive recall only 
* DV: number of correct recalled response & number of word pairs learned per minute 

M&P: 

* 60 pairs of Swahili-English is divided into 4 groups 
* Randomized initial study --> training condition (4 cycles) 
* In traning condition, 
  * Recognition condition: 
    * 2 productive recognition, 2 receptive recognition 
  * Recall condition: 
    * 2 productive recall, 2 receptive recall 
  * Hybrid: 
    * 1 productive recognition + 1 productive recall + 1 receptive recognition + 1 receptive recall 
  * Productive recall only: 
    * 4 productive recall questions 
* All final test is given in the order: productive recall --> productive recognition --> receptive recall --> receptive recognition 
  * Should probably do something like this 
  * Feedback is not provided in the posttest 

Result: 

* **Productive recall posttest (patterns hold in both immediate and delayed posttest)**
  * Strict: Recall = productive recall only > hybrid > recognition
  * Sensitive: recall > recognition 
* Receptive posttest: 
  * No sig. difference 
* Recognition posttest: 
  * No sig. difference 
* Efficiency: (divide posttest score by time)
  * **Productive recall posttest:**
    *  Recognition is most effiency, other no sig. diff'
  * Productive recognition posttest: 
    *  recognition > hybrid > recall = productive recall only
  * Receptive recognition & productive posttest: 
    * recognition > hybrid & recall & productive recall only 
    * hybrid > recall & productive recall 

Discussion & Limitation: 

* Productive recall always preceded receptive recall will boost the performance of receptive recall test  
  * Should counterbalanced or only one posttest 
  * Present study can resolve the question

* Implications of the declarative/procedural model for improving second language learning: The role of memory enhancement techniques
* https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0267658316675195

Result: 

* The benefits of retrieval practice often emerge only after a delay, before which restudy is either as useful or more useful than retrieval practice
* Some evidence suggests that the longer the retention delay, the greater the advantage of retrieval practice over restudy 
* Training with free recall (retrieval with no cue) generally results in greater retention than training with cued recall, which in turn leads to better retention than training with recognition tasks
* Delayed correct-answer feedback (e.g. a day after retrieval) seems to offer greater benefits over immediate feedback

    * French-English; test-different 
* Time of test: immediate posttest, 3-days dalyed, 7-days delayed, 28 days delayed 

M&P: 

* 20 English-French word pairs

Result: 

* Direction of the test have no sig. diff' 
  * Mean English-French posttest = Mean French-English posttest 
* General result: Test-same (59.59%) is better than test-different (33.7%) without interaction 
  * Productive posttest: productive > receptive 
  * Receptive posttest: receptive > productive 
  * Interaction with time is not reported 
* Receptive postest is a easier task than productive posttest consistent with Mondria & Wiersma (2004)
* Receptive test led to a substantial amount of productive knowledge, vice versa. 
* Direction of learning (productive vs. receptive) taken together have no effect on memory over time
* The total rention as a result of receptive learning decayed at a comparble rate as the total retention as a result of productive learning  

Discussion & Limitation: 

* No metion of interaction between directionality (test-same vs. test-different) of practice and posttest and time, but they also didn't explicitly report there are no interaction

IV & DV: 

* Half receptive training & half productive training 

M&P: 

* 50 English-French word pairs

* Immediate test 

Result: 

* Productive posttest: productive (15.1) > receptive (13.1)
* Receptive posttest: receptive (8) > productive (6)
* Receptive posttest is easier than productive posttest 
* Receptive test led to a substantial amount of productive knowledge, vice versa. 

Limitation: 

* Simple comparison of raw score 
* Did not control for order effect, productive test can give hint to the followed receptive test

* Receptive vs. productive learning 

M&P: 

* Qulatative result is also reported 
* Posttest is adminstred immediately, 1-day delayed, 1-week dalayed and three-months delay 

Result: 

* Productive learning took more time than receptive learning. 
* Receptive tests yielded higher test scores than productive tests
* Receptive learning led to a certain amount of productive knowledge and productive learning led to a certain amount of receptive knowledge 
* The best results on a receptive test were obtained when the words were learned receptively, and the best results on a productive test were obtained when the words were learned productively 
* Productive knowledge — whether acquired by productive learning or by receptive learning — decayed faster than receptive knowledge

Participants: 

* 64 non-French speaking college students 

IV & DV: 

* | Session 1      | Session 2      |
  | -------------- | -------------- |
  | English-French | English-French |
  | French-English | French-English |
  | French-English | English-French |
  | English-French | French-English |

  In immediate & delayed posttest, half take the English-French and the other half take the French-English 

M&P: 

* An immediate test is adminstred after session 1 training 

Result: 

* The receptive retention tests (both immediate and delayed) yielded higher scores than the productive retention tests. 
* Receptive learning led to a certain amount of productive knowledge (deayed retention test). Productive learning, however, led to a considerable amount of receptive knowledge (delayed retention test), an amount that was even comparable to that as a result of receptive learning

* Studying the 24 target words which is presented side by side
* Picture-L2 recall posttest & L2-L1 recall posttest is adminstred  
* Self-reported questionaire asking what strategy will be used during training 

Result: 

* Most frequent used strategies: 
  * L2-picture assoication: "Easiest for me to just remember a picture with a word"
  * L2-L1 assoication: "I associated the Spanish word with any English word"
  * L2-L1 translation: "I associated the Spanish word with the target English word"
  * Repetition: "repeated the word over in my head"
* Successful strategy:
  * L2-picture assocaition > repetition
  * L2-picture assocaition > L2-L1 translation
